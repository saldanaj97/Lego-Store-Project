# Lego Store Project
Project for CSCE 4350 Intro to Databases. 

This app is used to manage a lego store.\n\nEmployees can select the store mode option and which will require
the user to login to be able to access the options for store mode such as\n
   - Selling an item\n
   - Managing Orders\n
   - Managing the inventory database\n\n
Users can select online mode which will only require a login/account creation for ordering items 
and checking purchase history. Online mode functions include\n
   - Browsing inventory\n
   - Searching for a specific item\n
   - Checking puchase history\n\n

To get to store or online mode type in 'store' or 'online' and then you will be presented with options for that mode. \n\n
In order to make a selection, enter the number of the option that contains the desired selection. \n\n
To get out of the current mode, type 'main menu' from either mode and then type 'q' to quit the program. \n
