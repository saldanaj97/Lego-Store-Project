the user to login to be able to access the options for store mode such as

Users can select online mode which will only require a login/account creation for ordering items 
and checking purchase history. Online mode functions include
   - Browsing inventory
   - Searching for a specific item
   - Checking puchase history

To get to store or online mode type in 'store' or 'online' and then you will be presented with options for that mode. 

In order to make a selection, enter the number of the option that contains the desired selection. 

To get out of the current mode, type 'main menu' from either mode and then type 'q' to quit the program.
